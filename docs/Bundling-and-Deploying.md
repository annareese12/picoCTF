So far, we have created three challenges for our competition. On this page,
we're going to discuss how to bundle these challenges into one package
and the benefits of doing so.

A bundle is simply a group of challenges that can be distributed as one package.
Additionally, bundles allow you to specify the unlocking procedure for your challenges.

## Creating the Bundle

We will create a bundle containing our three example challenges. Creating a bundle requires
only a `bundle.json` file, as shown below.

```json
{
  "name": "Problem Sampler",
  "author": "YOUR NAME HERE",
  "description": "A set of challenges created for Train the Trainer.",
  "categories": ["Binary Exploitation", "Cryptography", "Web Exploitation"],
  "problems": ["buffer-overflow-1", "ecb-encryption", "sql-injection-1"],
  "dependencies": {
    "ecb-encryption": {
      "threshold": 1,
      "weightmap": {
        "buffer-overflow-1": 1
      }
    },
    "sql-injection-1": {
      "threshold": 1,
      "weightmap": {
        "buffer-overflow-1": 1,
        "ecb-encryption": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This `bundle.json` specifies all of the information needed to create a bundle. Be
sure to check out the [bundle.json Specification](Bundle.json)
to see the optional fields.

Be sure that you have installed all of the problem `.deb` files created previously.
Once you have done so, you can run `sudo shell_manager bundle bundle.json` to create
your bundled deb package.

You should continue by installing your bundle deb package as well, using
`sudo dpkg -i ctf-problem-sampler-bundle-1.0-0.deb`. This will make the bundle information available
to the `shell_manager`.

## Deploying the Bundle

Once we've installed the bundle, we can deploy 3 instances of each of our challenges
using `sudo shell_manager deploy -b train-the-trainer-sampler -n 3`.
